# Adjacency-Matrix-GeoJSON
Get Adjacency matrix for Polygons in GeoJSON using R:

I've got a set of polygons (neighborhoods in Boston from Uber Movement Dataset) in the GeoJSON file. I would like to produce an adjacency matrix in CSV format, where element j,j is 1 if district i is adjacent to district j (i.e. they are touching).
